1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   Implementing analysis, mainly type checking but also some offset allocation for > 4 byte types,
   for longs and doubles, operators, conditional expressions, do, for, break, and continue statements. Also
   implementing codegen for these as well, using logic and control-flow to determine how and which order to execute
   JVM instructions.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received

   ...                ...          ...

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   Was not able to figure out switch, exception handling, and interface type declaration.
