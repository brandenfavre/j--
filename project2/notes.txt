1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   Modified scanner to scan for multiline comments, more operators, reserved words,
   and long & double literals. Multiline comments checks for /* and then continuously
   scans the next char, essentially ignoring everything, until finding */ or EOF. Adding
   more operators was similar to the previous project, just adding tokens to the TokenInfo
   and adding scanning support. Adding new reserved words consisted of defining the tokens
   in TokenInfo and then using a Hashtable to store the reserved word image with the reserved
   word token. Adding the support for long and double literals relied on using Java's Grammar
   to scan the correct tokens, and in the correct order, in order to validate input as either
   literals.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.
