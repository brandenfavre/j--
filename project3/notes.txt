1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   Added support for the parsing of different types, operators, statements, exception
   handling, and interface declarations. For double and long, handled parsing the
   literals in literal(), and added their type into basicType(). Adding operators
   was similar to Project1, follow the grammar to implement the operators into the different expression
   methods. Conditional expression added a method to handle those types of expressions, similar
   to many other conditional expression methods. Do statement was straightforward, just following
   the grammar to implement in the statement() method. For statement was more complex, having
   to use variableDeclarator list to return a single object to encapsulate variable declarations, and
   following the grammar for the rest. Break and continue were simple, relying on a correct implementation
   of the For statement. The switchstatement uses the switchBlockStatementGroup() which
   implements the grammar for switchLabel as well. The default case also needed a empty label so the AST
   displayed properly. Exception handling was straightforward, following the grammar. Interface was
   more complicated, but shared similar logic to memberDecl and classBody, so after updating those methods to
   contain the proper updated grammar, it was straightforward. There was also the need to add the "abstract"
   modifier to interface methods as all interface methods are implicitly abstract.
