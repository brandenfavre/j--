1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   Redoing projects 2 and 3 using JavaCC for grammar. Different way in how JavaCC
   handles optional instances and 0 or more occurrences, not having to rely on if statements
   and while loops, instead using [] for 0 or 1 occurrence and ()* for 1 or more occurrences.
   Other than the different ways JavaCC handles grammar, project4 was not really different
   from projects 2 and 3, in terms of the logic in implementing java grammar to j--.
