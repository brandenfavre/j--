1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   For problem 1, learned how to use CLEmitter and how to build a .class file for j-- from executing JVM instructions
   represented using CLEmitter. Problems 2-4 were similar in adding operators to TokenInfo, modifying the Scanner to
   scan for these operators properly, then modifying Parser to validate proper use of these operators, and implementing
   the analyze and codegen methods in the methods corresponding to the operators in the JUnaryExpression and
   JBinaryExpression classes to construct an AST for each operator using CLEmitter again for representing JVM
   instructions in codegen and validating the lhs/rhs of the operators were primitive integers in analyze.
   Figuring out the proper grammar for modifying the parser was gotten from looking at the Java Grammar file.
